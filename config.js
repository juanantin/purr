                          indexed a token in its first days.
         geckoterminal  — free, no key. Only has a count for tokens it indexes.

                          its tokenholdercount action requires a PAID plan.
         moralis        — needs `moralisApiKey`; the free tier is enough.

       Providers without a key are skipped, so the key-free ones are tried first
       and the rest only engage once you fill a key in.

       ▸ The reliable answer is the indexer in worker/: it counts holders from
         the token's own transfer history, so it needs no explorer at all. Once
         it is deployed and synced it supplies `holders` through sources.rewards

         2. run the "Index rewards" workflow (scripts/index-rewards.mjs), which
            sums transfers on Base and rewrites that file on a schedule

            its URL first in `url`, with the committed file as the fallback

       `fields` maps our metric names onto whatever shape the response has.

       that resolves to a number wins, so usually you just add yours to the

       A remote endpoint must send permissive CORS headers, since the browser
       calls it directly. If it doesn't, proxy it from your own domain.
